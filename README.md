Optical character recognition

We have an image of a number (0-9) and we want to find out which number it is.
We draw these images in paint.net, import them in the project and transform them into numerical data.

Input layer:
    we have 5x5 pixel images
    we will need 25 input neurons

Output layer:
    we have 10 output neurons because the expected output is 10 different digits
